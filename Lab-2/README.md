# You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:
1. Enter a name
2. Search for a name
3. Remove a name
Note:
The menu-driven program has to be made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.
Constraints:
1. The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
2. The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
3. Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
4. Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
5. Format your results properly!!
